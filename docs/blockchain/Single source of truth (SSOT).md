In [information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science "Information science") and [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology"), **single source of truth** (**SSOT**) architecture, or **single point of truth** (**SPOT**) architecture, for [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system "Information system") is the practice of structuring [information models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_model "Information model") and associated [data schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema "Database schema") such that every [data element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element "Data element") is [mastered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_record_\(informatics\) "Golden record (informatics)") (or edited) in only one place, providing [data normalization to a canonical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_form#Computing "Canonical form") (for example, in [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization "Database normalization") or content [transclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion "Transclusion")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth#cite_note-1)

There are several scenarios with respect to copies and updates:

- The master data is never copied and instead only references to it are made; this means that all reads and updates go directly to the SSOT.
- The master data is copied but the copies are only read and only the master data is updated; if requests to read data are only made on copies, this is an instance of [CQRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQRS "CQRS").
- The master data is copied and the copies are updated; this needs a reconciliation mechanism when there are concurrent updates.
    - Updates on copies can be thrown out whenever a concurrent update is made on the master, so they are not considered fully committed until propagated to the master. (many blockchains work that way.)
    - Concurrent updates are merged. (if an automatic merge fails, it could fall back on another strategy, which could be the previous strategy or something else like manual intervention, which most source version control systems do.)

The advantages of SSOT architectures include easier prevention of mistaken inconsistencies (such as a duplicate value/copy somewhere being forgotten), and greatly simplified [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Version control"). Without a SSOT, dealing with inconsistencies implies either complex and error-prone consensus algorithms, or using a simpler architecture that's liable to lose data in the face of inconsistency (the latter may seem unacceptable but it is sometimes a very good choice; it is how most blockchains operate: a transaction is actually final only if it was included in the next block that is mined).
