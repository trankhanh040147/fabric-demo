# What is peer to peer network ?

**Peer-to-peer** (**P2P**) computing or networking is a [distributed application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_application "Distributed application") architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, [equipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipotent "Equipotent") participants in the network, forming a peer-to-peer network of [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_\(networking\) "Node (networking)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-1) In addition, a [personal area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network "Personal area network") (PAN) is also in nature a type of [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing "Decentralized computing") peer-to-peer network typically between two devices.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-2)

The opposite of a peer-to-peer network: based on the **[client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model")**, where individual [_clients_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_\(computing\) "Client (computing)") request services and resources from centralized [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_\(computing\) "Server (computing)")

Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage, or [network bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bandwidth "Network bandwidth"), directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-3) Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") in which the consumption and supply of resources are divided.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-CP2P-4)

While P2P systems had previously been used in many [application domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_domain "Application domain"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-D._Barkai,_2002-5) the architecture was popularized by the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") file sharing system [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster "Napster"), originally released in 1999.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-6) P2P is used in many protocols such as [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent "BitTorrent") file sharing over the Internet[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-7) and in [personal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network "Personal area network") like [Miracast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast "Miracast") displaying and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth "Bluetooth") radio.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-8) The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts, [peer-to-peer as a meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_\(meme\) "Peer-to-peer (meme)") refers to the [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarian "Egalitarian") [social networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network "Social network") that has emerged throughout society, enabled by [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") technologies in general.

# How peer-to-peer network works ?
- Nếu một peer (mạng) cần resource mà một peer khác có, peer đó có thể kết nối trực tiếp đến peer sở hữu resource và lấy resource đó.
# How peer-to-peer works in BitTorrent ?
- Người dùng có thể tải file bằng cách nhận nhiều phần nhỏ của file từ những user khác có sở hữu phần đó 
	- Nếu một user sở hữu phần đó bị ngắt kết nối, thì ?

- [ ] Peer-to-peer computing vs client / server architecture 
This means that conceptually, peer-to-peer computing is an alternative to the traditional client / server architecture where there typically is a single (or small cluster) server and many clients

- [ ] Original of peer to peer concept
Sticking with the previous definition, the concept of peerto-peer can be traced back to the 1960’s when the early implementation of the Internet (ARPANET) was a peerto-peer network in which all its peers were equals. However, this definition can be fitted into many scenarios. 

- [ ] DNS and peer-to-peer
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a good example of a blend between the traditional peer-to-peer networking and a hierarchical model of information ownership. A more precise definition is stated in [17] as: “A distributed network architecture may be called a Peer-to-Peer (P-to-P, P2P,...) network, if the participants share a part of their own (hardware) resources (processing power, storage capacity, network link capacity, printers,...). These shared resources are necessary to provide the Service and content offered by the network (e.g. file sharing or shared workspaces for collaboration). They are accessible by other peers directly, without passing intermediary entities. The participants of such a network are thus resource (Service and content) providers as well as resource (Service and content) requestors (Servant-concept).” [17]
