This model is designed to handle simple failures, like a server crashing or going offline. It assumes that participants are **honest** and are not actively trying to cheat the system. If a participant stops working, it's considered an accident.

- **Trust Model:** High trust. Participants are cooperative.
    
- **Analogy:** Imagine a team of clerks counting votes. CFT ensures that if one clerk faints and falls over (a crash), the others can continue their work and still get the correct final count. It doesn't, however, protect against a clerk who is secretly trying to change votes.
